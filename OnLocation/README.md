# On Location

Exploring JavaCV, Making Movies.

CameraPanel is a Swing compliant component that suppresses Java's scaling of images for HiDPI screens, allowing user to determine level digital zoom they want.

CameraPanelController sets up and manages the controls for controlling zoom and pan within the CameraPanel.

CameraDriver uses SwingWorker to keep the Swing EDT responsive throughout video capture.

## Getting Started

Clone to your local computer and fire up eclipse.

Running OnLocation will connect to the first camera it finds. Use the Config toggle to open the camera selector pane. 

### Prerequisites

Being developed using Java 11
